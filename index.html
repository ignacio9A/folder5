    <h1> Activity </h1>
    <p>what skills and values are most important for young people to develop in world increasingly dominated by technology?</p>
</header>
<section>
<h1> For skills, I would say communication or rather speaking fluenty in a language and proper grammar. also being hardworking and diligent because laziness gets the better of you, it is also one of the reason why people are being replaced with ai/robots at work. Also just being good in stuff, because it really depends on what you'll do in life if you want to be an IT you have to be skillfull in using a computer and technology. if you want to be in business you have to be skillfull in communicating and be creative. Also rterally in life the most important skill is hgow to survive and social stuff it is very important 
        </h1>
<h2>In values theres alot i would say respect, it is a important and practiced values mostpeople have and if you don't have it you need ity sinec it is veryn important. Second is manner respect liesin manner with proper respect you must also have proper manner. Third is good will,  goodwill is very important since this is part of your personality, Honestly if people don't have goodwill the world would be doomed. no goodwill is practically no humanity. Fourth is principles, values with principles is very important i'm  sure that everyon has principles since principles are the things that you follow and believe. With proper principles you might have proper values too. Fifth is honesty, everyone wants honesty it's what saves humanity hinesty is very imortant in life because people will see in or judge you based on your honesty. Ifyou aren't honest people might not trust you easily and this wil be a problem for you in life    </h2>
